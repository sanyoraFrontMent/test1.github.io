        <h3>Stories and practices of erotic massage</h3>

        <p>
          What is the most important skill of an erotic masseuse in a salon?<br>
          <br>
          To make people feel good about themselves? Feel the body? Virtuoso work with hands? <br>
          <br>
          Of course, all this is a must. But to be honest, the first thing you have to learn is ... to dodge! <br>
          <br>
          And not from attempts to grope in forbidden places, as strange as it may seem. But from the obvious manifestations of male reciprocity. <br>
          <br>
          The overwhelming majority of the guests think that to lie dumb during the massage is a bad thing. That it is necessary to show the masseuse how active you are, how important for you her pleasure is. <br>
          <br>
          What an amazingly attentive, responsive to affection and not indifferent men we have! I do remember with great warmth how important it was for the guests to make me feel good, too. <br>
          <br>
          True, because of that I have repeatedly received a finger in the eye, a knee on the head, and a foot in the back))) Completely accidental, of course. Just stroking a girl who massages your back with her breasts is not a trivial task)) <br>
          <br>
          And after all, in order for a girl to get as much pleasure as a man in the process of massage, it is not necessary to be active at all. One of the guests once showed me this very vividly. <br>
          <br>
          The program was the most simple and popular - an hour of erotic body massage. I could do this massage without waking up, so worked up was his pattern. <br>
          <br>
          He was almost my height, lean, with a light tan and a pulling accent. We said hello, washed up in the shower, everything completely normal. The guest lay down on the tatami, and I began applying oil to my legs and back. Rolling my breasts over my body, I felt that my skin was firm and pleasant, and my muscles were tense quite a bit, for sure the man was watching my body. <br><br>
          Consistently working each muscle, starting at the feet, I felt pure pleasure in the creation. There wasn't a single clamp, every nerve knot worked the way it should. My hands felt each movement respond in the body exactly as it was intended. And my brain happily let go of the situation and enjoyed the process. <br>
          <br>
          My guest made no movement toward me, didn't even move a finger, but his body was directly melting, accepting the care. His skin, slightly slippery from the oil, was supple and docile, his muscles almost groaning with pleasure as he stretched. As I began to massage my own body, my cool skin was infused with his warmth, and I wanted to glide even slower, even more sensual, even tighter. Finally, I lay down on top of him, my whole body pressed tightly against his. My nose dug between his shoulder and neck, breathing in the scent of the man's skin, with a slight hint of heated massage oil. It was amazingly cozy, our breathing in sync, and my chest felt his heartbeat. <br>
          <br>
          It was time to flip my guest over onto his back and begin more explicit caresses. The whole time I slid my breasts over his legs and stomach, he lay still. But I could hear his breathing, which was becoming deeper and more concentrated. And my erection left no doubt that I was doing everything right. <br>
          <br>
          Finally, I sat on top of him, facing his legs, and started caressing him with my hands. <br>
          <br>
          And he put his hands on my lower back. At first he just did, and then he started lightly stroking my back with his whole palm. Mommy, what was that like? <br>
          <br>
          He stroked me very gently, but his palms were very hot and tight against my skin. I felt as if the heat from those palms was spreading absolutely everywhere, flowing down my body, caressing me. When he ran his hands up my sides and I felt as if those heated palms were about to cover my breasts, they suddenly pulled away, staying at the very edge of my touch, and went down. There was a relentless rhythm to his movements that was impossible not to obey. And my hands, which were massaging my lingam at the time, instantly adjusted. It turned out that he was only controlling the massage by gently touching my back, and it gave me an amazing sense of oneness, as if someone else's voice was merging in unison with yours. <br>
          <br>
          When my guest took his hands off my back and wrapped his palms tightly around my buttocks, it was clear that he was close to discharging. And at that very moment, his fingers plunged convulsively into my skin, transmitting some of his pleasure and gratitude to me. <br>
          <br>
          Then we lay cuddled together. My guest held me gently against him, and I stroked his face. It was enough to realize that for both of us, the massage was an absolutely wonderful moment of intimacy. <br>
          <br>
          A few days later, he came again. And it was delightful, because it was easier for us than the first time. And the program gave more room for improvisation, although there was certainly no sex in the usual sense. <br>
          <br>
          But I know for sure, this man is an amazing lover. <br>
          <br>
          The ability to feel his partner, to trust him, to take the initiative and give it to the other is exactly what can turn any intimacy into a real extravaganza. <br>
          <br>
          You need to learn not so much what to do with your lover's body, but when to do it. At the right moment, even the simplest touch can give an explosion of sensations and even end in an orgasm. <br>
          <br>
          Enjoy each other to the fullest without giving up anything less!
